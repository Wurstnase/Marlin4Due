## Quick Information     

This is a firmware for reprap single-processor electronics setups.    
It also works on the Ultimaker PCB. It supports printing from SD card+Folders and look-ahead trajectory planning.    
This firmware is a mashup between [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter), [grbl](https://github.com/simen/grbl), and many original parts.     

## Current Status: Pre-alpha - do not use it on Davinci unless to help
